Adding branching and merging to a simplified version control system within a 2-hour timeframe is still a significant challenge, but let's adapt the exercise to include these concepts along with some bonus features. Keep in mind that this is a very simplified representation and does not cover all complexities of a full-fledged version control system like Git.

**Project Description: Simple Version Control System with Branching and Merging**

**Objective:** Build a simplified version control system using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to track changes in a text file, create branches, and merge branches.

**Requirements:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Create a basic HTML structure with a text area for file content.
   - Include buttons for "Save," "Commit," "View History," "Create Branch," "Switch Branch," and "Merge Branch."

2. **Save Functionality:**
   - When the "Save" button is clicked, save the current content of the text area as a new version.
   - Prompt the user to enter a commit message for the save.

3. **Commit Functionality:**
   - When the "Commit" button is clicked, commit the current changes along with the commit message to the current branch.
   - Store commits in an array or an object with a timestamp.
   
4. **View History Functionality:**
   - When the "View History" button is clicked, display a list of all commits with their respective timestamps, commit messages, and associated branches.
   - Allow users to click on a commit to view the content of that specific commit.

5. **Create Branch Functionality:**
   - When the "Create Branch" button is clicked, prompt the user to enter a branch name.
   - Create a new branch based on the current state of the current branch and switch to the new branch.

6. **Switch Branch Functionality:**
   - When the "Switch Branch" button is clicked, prompt the user to select a branch from a list of available branches.
   - Switch to the selected branch, updating the file content to match the latest commit on that branch.

7. **Merge Branch Functionality:**
   - When the "Merge Branch" button is clicked, prompt the user to select a branch to merge into the current branch.
   - Merge the selected branch into the current branch, updating the file content and commit history accordingly.

**Bonus Features (Optional):**

8. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Implement a basic conflict resolution mechanism for merging branches, allowing the user to resolve conflicts manually.

9. **Visual Branch Graph:**
   - Display a visual representation of the branch history, showing the relationships between branches and their commits.

**Hints:**
- Use JavaScript to handle the logic for saving, committing, viewing history, creating branches, switching branches, and merging.
- Use HTML for the user interface elements.
- Use CSS to style the interface and make it user-friendly.
- You can store commits, branches, and their relationships in JavaScript objects.

**Constraints:**
- This is a highly simplified representation of branching and merging, and it does not cover all the complexities of a full Git-like system.
- Assume a single text file for simplicity.
- Use browser localStorage to store data for the duration of the session (not suitable for real-world use).

Building a basic branching and merging system within a 2-hour timeframe is challenging, so prioritize essential functionality and focus on a simplified user interface.
